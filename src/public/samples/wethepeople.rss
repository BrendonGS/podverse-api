      <title>EP 138. IS CAMPUS RAPE WIDESPREAD?</title>
      <description>Bettina Arndt is lighting up university campuses by giving speeches analyzing the data about campus rape. She says she's empowering young women to be bold and unafraid. Her critics say she dangerously downplays the risk posed by men. Arndt is a celebrity sex adviser who has written for the biggest newspapers, hosted a radio show, and even interviewed His Holiness The Reverend Jordan Peterson. She's either an alt-right anti-feminist fascist, or one of Australia's edgiest pro-sex feminists. You decide. ​&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>EP 131. TREVOR NOAH &amp; RACE</title>
      <description>The French soccer team that won the World Cup was pretty black. Too black, apparently, for racists, white supremacists and... Daily Show host Trevor Noah? A brouhaha between Trevor Noah and the French Government gives us an insight into the vast difference between how French and American liberals think about race and identity. In France, identity politics is considered toxic -- particularly by the Left. John Lichfield understands both perspectives. He's a Brit who's lived in the US and France, and worked for 20 years as the Paris correspondent for Britain's The Independent newspaper. He won the UK Press Awards Foreign Reporter of the year for his French reporting. Josh and John wrestle with identity politics on both sides of the pond.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about your ad choices.

      <description>Rachel Corbett is the Director of Podcasts for Mamamia and a panelist on the TV show The Project. In a refreshing absence of political news, she explains to Josh why he should care about the saga of the 11 boys who were trapped in a Thai cave for 17 days. (He finds such stories self-indulgent because he is a heartless monster.) AND is social media making you mad?

      <itunes:summary>
        <![CDATA[Rachel Corbett is the Director of Podcasts for Mamamia and a panelist on the TV show The Project. In a refreshing absence of political news, she explains to Josh why he should care about the saga of the 11 boys who were trapped in a Thai cave for 17 days. (He finds such stories self-indulgent because he is a heartless monster.) AND is social media making you mad?

      <title>EP 119. WILL JOHN BOLTON DESTROY THE WORLD?</title>
      <description>A sea change is sweeping the White House. A new Secretary of State. A new CIA chief. And a new National Security Advisor, John Bolton. Will he destroy the world? "Yeah, probably." That's the hunch of the decidedly un-hysterical, deeply informed Anthony L. Fisher. Anthony is an independent, libertarian-minded columnist and contributing writer for The Week and The Daily Beast. His film, Sidewalk Traffic, is available on all major streaming services. He's a former producer at the Fox Business Network, where he met Bolton. And he never waves his arms hysterically about The Grave Threat Trump Poses To The World... until now. Find out why.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>EP 114. GUNS IN AMERICA</title>
      <description>Every time there's a mass shooting in America, Josh considers recording this monologue and then shies away. But in the wake of the second-deadliest shooting at a public school in US history, Josh ditches our regular episode to bring you his unique perspective as a foreigner living in America -- without Piers Morgan's pompous dickheadery. Non-Americans and Americans will both enjoy this one-man debate exploring Australia's gun reforms, global violence, the Second Amendment, America's gun safety stalemate, whether to ban surfing, and the coming dystopian apocalypse. Enjoy!&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about your ad choices.

      <description>By the time you’re old, the idea of eating a burger that was sliced off the body of a dead cow may seem as antiquated as using a whale’s fat to light your home. That’s the hope of Paul Shapiro, whose new bestselling book, Clean Meat: How Growing Meat Without Animals Will Revolutionize Dinner and the World, is a wild dive into the scientific and moral promise of lab-grown meat. Will vegans be chomping on burgers? Will chickens no longer have brains? Paul is the founder of Compassion Over Killing and the former VP &amp;amp; Spokesperson of the Humane Society of the United States. Join him and Josh as they wrestle with the big questions of animal welfare, ethics, biology... and the food revolution that’s coming.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>EP 111. AUSTRALIA DAY: LIVE FROM SYDNEY!</title>
      <description>Happy Australia Day, America. We discuss why Australia's national day is so controversial (hint: lots of Aboriginal people got killed), what makes Aussies weird, what perplexes us about Americans, why some countries truly are shitholes, and why babies should never be allowed at the tennis. Join a blockbuster panel of comics and journalists: James Valentine, host of ABC Radio; Becky Lucas, rising star comedian; and James Mathison, political candidate and former host of Australian Idol.

        <![CDATA[Happy Australia Day, America. We discuss why Australia's national day is so controversial (hint: lots of Aboriginal people got killed), what makes Aussies weird, what perplexes us about Americans, why some countries truly are shitholes, and why babies should never be allowed at the tennis.

      <title>EP 110. RICHARD DAWKINS</title>
      <description>Two days after Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton in the presidential election, Josh sat down with one of the world's greatest scientists and rationalists, Richard Dawkins, at a live event at Philadelphia's Penn Museum. Since it's the one-year anniversary of Trump's presidency this week, we're releasing the exclusive audio of "An Evening With Richard Dawkins in Conversation with Josh Zepps". The two of them grapple with science, reason, Islam, faith, and the shell-shock they feel at the biggest political upset of our time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about your ad choices.

His weekly column in The Guardian debates insights into social psychology, self-help culture, productivity and the science of happiness. His book, The Antidote: Happiness for People Who Can't Stand Positive Thinking, is a tour de force argument in favor of negativity, uncertainty, failure and imperfection.

      <title>EP. 99 BRET WEINSTEIN: FREE SPEECH HERO, OR WHITE-PRIVILEGED DICK?</title>
      <description>Professor Bret Weinstein is the man at the center of the Evergreen College crisis. At this moment of national angst about racial equity, free speech and campus protests, Bret’s story has exploded everywhere from the New York Times to Fox News—the tale of the unassuming Biology Professor who stood up to radical left-wing students and found himself in the eye of the storm. But... who is this guy? What does he really believe? Josh and Bret sit down, not to discuss what happened—you can hear that elsewhere—but to discuss how his ideas led him here: Ideas about equality, learning, justice, and Ritalin.

      <title>EP. 98 “THE RED PILL” AND MEN’S RIGHTS</title>
      <description>What is male privilege? What is female empowerment? Is it misogynistic to criticize feminism? Is it wrong to care about “men’s rights”? The argument has erupted again in Australia amid protests over a new American documentary funded by Men's Rights Activists. The filmmaker, an “ex-feminist” woman, had a controversial TV interview with today's guest, the Aussie television personality Rachel Corbett. Protests erupted. The film's premiere was canceled. Rachel sits down with Josh to hammer out her thoughts about feminism, equality, and and the unfairer sex. An earlier version of this conversation was briefly released in error last week.

      <description>Ali Rizvi grew up in Libya, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan, and moved to North America when he was 24. He now writes about atheism, secularism and Islam. In the wake of the Manchester concert attack and two London terrorist attacks, Ali and Josh dig into the thorny topic of how to reform Islam without tarnishing Muslims. Can the Koran be taken less seriously? Should Western feminists stop glorifying the hijab? Can we quit it with identity politics? And what is the real, deeper damage done by terrorism? Ali’s book is The Atheist Muslim. After hearing this conversation, you’ll wanna read it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>EP. 87 WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS' DINNER</title>
      <description>James West and Ben Dreyfus are young renegade reporters who work as Senior Editors at the non-profit investigative news magazine Mother Jones. They recently attended the White House Correspondents' Dinner which President Trump ducked. They join Josh to discuss the public's cynicism towards the press, and journalists' relationship to power. (Plus, news of the firing of James Comey, the FBI Director, breaks while we're recording.) Is "fake news" real? Is Bob Woodward a schmuck? Is the White House Correspondents' Dinner more than a vapid, back-slapping schmooze-fest? Yes, maybe and no.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about your ad choices.

      <description>
        
        
        Three big stories are coming out of EuropaLand this week, and Josh wants to figure out what they mean for you. First, the UK just announced a surprise early election; second, France goes to the polls next week in an election that could blow up the E.U. and see a victory for the Far Right; and third, Turkish voters just handed their president quasi-dictatorial powers. Slate’s June Thomas and FreeThink’s Kmele Foster help Josh unpack the deeper significance of these seismic shifts across the pond. Switch on your book-learnin’ noggins, humans, and enjoy.

        The world has gone gaga over a viral video of an innocent passenger being dragged violently off a plane. Why? Why are we so transfixed? Why are airlines so crappy, and cops so aggressive? Why are corporations so cynical, and why do we stand by? Josh convenes a special #WeThePeople Flying-In-America Summit with a trio of sassy travel experts to debate #Bumpgate, state violence, corporate BS, and what this means for us all.

      <title>EP. 80 FRANK RICH : DEFENDING THE BUBBLE</title>
      <description>
        
        
        Should Democrats give a damn about hillbillies? They seem to feel they should. Since Trump, there’s been much hand-wringing about how to escape the liberal bubble and understand the white rural working poor. “Quit it”, says Frank Rich, the editor-at-large for New York magazine and executive producer of Veep on HBO. He was the titan of the New York Times opinion pages for two decades, and he’s as thoughtful and provocative as ever. Make debate healthy again? Maybe. Or maybe not with rednecks.

      <title>EP.79 ANDY KINDLER VS TWITTER</title>
      <description>
        
        
        It's been a controversial week for comedy legend Andy Kindler. The Letterman alum kicked a hornet's nest by tweeting that Sam Harris is an anti-Muslim bigot... on what turned out to be the eve of a jihadist attack on Westminster. Harris pushed back. A Twitter shit-storm ensued. #WeThePeople LIVE is the only show that has featured both Harris and Kindler as recent guests, so we sought a détente. Josh spoke with Sam via email, and sat down with Andy to discuss the disagreement, Islam, bigotry, and the ugliness of trolling. Who's right? Who's wrong? You decide! Our thanks to Harris and Kindler for their time. Make debate healthy again, humans.

      <title>EP 78. LOUIS THEROUX</title>
      <description>
        
        
        Louis Theroux is one of the most important figures on British TV. His BBC documentaries have won him two BAFTAs, an Emmy nomination and superstar status across the pond (and Down Under). Louis started out as a correspondent on Michael Moore’s NBC show "TV Nation" and then got his own show examining weird aspects of humankind. His latest foray is “My Scientology Movie”, a documentary feature film. Louis sat down with Josh to discuss religion, politics, creativity and what we mean when we say we “believe” something. (It's, like, heavy, dude. In a nice British way.)

      <description>
        
        
        What does a sharp New York gal from a Trump-voting Wisconsin county think about the President's first speech to Congress? And about Syrians? And about identity politics? And about end-of-life health care for greedy baby boomers? Why, Josh digs into it all in this Not-a-State-of-the-Union post mortem with the Daily Beast's Erin Gloria Ryan, host of the Girl Friday podcast. Lap it up, humans!

      <title>EP. 73 MYQ KAPLAN THE PHILOSOPHER COMIC KING</title>
      <description>
        
        
        Free will! Marxism! Moral philosophy! Cruelty to animals! Cruelty to Nazis! Sam Harris! Peter Singer! This week, Josh takes a break from politics in a wide-ranging, thought-provoking dialog with the wisest comedian we know, Myq Kaplan. The two of them ponder veganism, ayahuasca, factory farms, refugees, and the inexplicable narcissism of the Orange President (okay, of course they don’t avoid politics 100%.) Myq’s new comedy album, No Kidding, drops on February 17th. Buckle up, humans, for this non-stop ride to brainy-town.

      <description>
        
        
        Probably not. Who knows? Maybe Medium.com does. Several articles have gone viral on Facebook with titles like "“Trial balloon for a coup." Might the chaos of Trump's first two weeks be a deception? Whom should we believe, dear listener? Why, Josh! He gets down with the writer of one of Medium's most viral articles, "The Immigration Ban is a Headfake, and We’re Falling For It" -- the successful Silicon Valley entrepreneur and CEO, Jake Fuentes. Democracy! Fake news! World affairs! Steve Bannon! It's all sexy. It's all here. Enjoy.

        After a relaxing holiday hiatus, we're back! 

And so is America's political shitstorm. Amid sordid rumors about his links to Russia, Trump held his first press conference as president-elect. Today, Josh is joined from Moscow by Russian dissident journalist Alexey Kovalev to discuss Putin's press conferences, fake news, and the future of the media in a strongman state (not before, of course, Josh dishes his thoughts on golden showers and the dreaded dossier.) 

Welcome back, humans!

      <description>
        
        
        Josh is joined by white Republican female human Carrie Sheffield and non-white Democratic female human Samhita Mukopadhyay. But we don't see labels, coz we're, like, so totes beyond identity.

      <title>Ep. 46 Which Lives Matter?  </title>
      <description>
        
        
        Welcome back to a heated three person panel WTPL.  This episode was recorded last night as the attacks in France were unfolding, so Josh and guests had time to reflect on the current shit show that was developing and look back at last week's tragedies.  Josh was joined by Chris Hamilton, Jeff Kreisler, and Mona Salama.

Thank you to Majority FM for letting us yell in their studio.

        Welcome back to a heated three person panel WTPL.  This episode was recorded last night as the attacks in France were unfolding, so Josh and guests had time to reflect on the current shit show that was developing and look back at last week's tragedies.  Josh was joined by Chris Hamilton, Jeff Kreisler, and Mona Salama.

Thank you to Majority FM for letting us yell in their studio.

      <title>Dave Rubin and Josh Talk... Finally. </title>
      <description>
        
        
        You spoke, humans, and we listened. After much clamouring from their mutual fans, Josh finally caught up with Dave Rubin: comic, TV host, anti-regressive-leftist and Islamophobia-phobe. Tune in as they discuss politics, culture, terrorism, liberalism and political correctness. This is one banter you don't wanna miss.

        Welcome to Part II of our special Australian Election coverage. 

Josh jumped on the Skype with Charlie Pickering (basically Australia's John Oliver) to flesh out what the hell happened at the Aussie election over the weekend. It's a cliffhanger, folks.

      <description>
        
        
        Guess what? There was an election in Australia! A big one! A weird one!

In part #1 of our two-part AustralianElectionPalooza Special, Josh sits down with the wildly popular Aussie comic and TV host Wil Anderson to help Americans feel better about their screwed-up democracy by discussing Australia's maybe-even-more-screwed-up one. You won't find political analysis like this anywhere else.

        Welcome to another odd WeThePeople LIVE!

Due to a last minute emergency Josh handed the reigns to beloved WTPL vet Michael Brooks.  
Joining Michael were three delightful guest: Kevin Allison, Roger Sachar, and Aparna Nancherla.  The four make debate very healthy with rather different takes on Orlando, internet activism, and what kind of mom Hillary Clinton is.

      <title>Excerpt-- How we talk about terrorism in wake of Orlando </title>
      <description>
        
        
        PODCAST’S PRESCIENT DEBATE ON ISLAMISM, HOMOPHOBIA &amp; TERRORISM

In a conversation that now feels tragically relevant, the most recent episode of #WeThePeople LIVE—released the day before the Orlando attack—featured a heated disagreement about Islam, homophobia and terrorism.

The show’s host, Josh Zepps, disagreed with his guests, VICE producers Abdullah Saeed and Anthony Lappe, about how we ought to discuss Islamist terrorism, homophobia and illiberalism. Should progressives claim that jihad "has nothing to do with Islam"? Or does political correctness only leave the door open to anti-Muslim bigotry?

In the aftermath of last night’s horrific events, listen to the exchange and tell us: How do you think we should discuss Islamist violence?

      <title>Ep. 41 Ryan Singer- Home is Where the Toilet is </title>
      <description>
        
        
        Welcome back humans!

During our trip to LA Josh and I looked for all the free coffee and bacon we could get and it led us to Ryan Singer's door.  Luckily, Ryan doesn't just make good coffee and bacon but he's a fantastic and weird comic.  This is an episode with insights on pooping and spiritual belief... what more do you need?

      <title>Ep. 35 So We Publicly Shame LIVE </title>
      <description>
        
        
        Welcome back humans!

Welcome back our all-star panel from last week, Jon Ronson, Corinne Fisher, Kystyna Hutchinson, and Artie Lange stayed on to discuss something they are truly experts on... shame.  
Jon's last book ("So You've Been Publicly Shamed"which is now available in paperback) dealt with our culture of public shaming, so we thought it'd be fascinating to put him on a stage with people who've made a career talking about their shame, and humiliating others.  

You should let us know if you found it as fascinating as we thought it would be.  @WTP_LIVE @JoshZepps

      <title>Ep. 31 The Most Extreme Reasonable Debate We've Moderated...</title>
      <description>
        
        
        Hello Humans!

Welcome back!  Welcome to the most intense debate we've ever hosted!  The most extreme discussion on ideology, and social structures-- nope!  Felix Salmon and Anthony Fisher have a fascinating and all too healthy conversation on libertarian ideals overlapping with liberal goals.  It's nerdy, it's funny, it's just what you'd expect.

Make Debate Healthy Again Humans.

      <title>Ep. 30 WTPL REWIND with Joe Rogan</title>
      <description>
        
        
        
A very special hour long episode of #WTP LIVE!  Host, Josh Zepps, sits down with the comic philosopher Joe Rogan.  

The two compare their world views on Bernie Sanders, inequality, extremism, and just about everything else you'd expect.  But, they don't just cover the news, they examine whether the current events are showing that the human species is evolving towards an enlightenment.  It's quite the hour.  

Thank you so much for listening.

        Hello Humans!

Welcome back to another election special.  This weekJosh took it upon himself to make debate healthy while sitting down, one on one, with Harvey Kaye.  Harvey is a bonafide Bernie supporter and Josh puts his feet to the fire (while they both laugh, of course) to see what he's made of.

        Welcome back to a genuinely live #WeThePeople LIVE, and it is damn lively!  Pine Box Rockshop was packed with a fantastic crowd and panel, dedicated to making debate healthy.  Josh was joined by returning greats, Felix Salmon, Anthony Fisher, Abbi Crutchfield, and Myq Kaplan.  Everyone came ready to throw down on pressing issues like Beyoncé, gravity and black holes (kid you not), and the recent words of Gloria Steinem.

      <title>Ep. 26 Unlive- But Should We Talk About It?</title>
      <description>
        
        
        Welcome back humans!

This is an Unlive, and not even an Unlive at the bar-- wait don't feel betrayed....  We felt that with this ongoing election cycle that it'd be fun to examine the whole process from floor to ceiling, or from whatever points we don't find boring.  But, we also thought some of these conversations need quieter settings.  So, for part one of an on going series, we welcome back John Opdycke to look at this whole primaries thing.  

Will be back next week at Pine Box Rock Shop ready to throw down on the weeks news.  Till then, help make debate healthy again.

      <description>
        
        
        Welcome to a brand new #WeThePeople LIVE!

Before I tell you about the episode, here's a quick note:
We are now proud members of the Acast Platform!  What's that mean for you?  Well, it means we have ads now, and it means we can keep doing the show and can get more ambitious.  Now, the polite thing to say is "congratulations" and keep your grumbling to yourself.  

And you will forget all your grumbles once you listen to this episode.  Artie Lange, Jamia Wilson, and Michael Brooks, sat down with Josh to discuss how divided is the state of our union.  This panel was pretty divided when they walked in the room, here what actually went down.

      <title>Ep. 22 Un-Live: What America is Best At....</title>
      <description>
        
        
        Welcome to a WeThePeople doubleheader! 

Today, Josh had two seperate conversations about what America does best... incarerate people... (sigh).  But as always, both of these serious conversations come with snark, and more laughs than should be appropriate.  First, Josh talks to Vice's Anthony Lappé to provide the broad view of the problem, then he sits down with Jeffrey Smith, a former Senator, and a former inmate.  

Enjoy!

        Welcome to a WeThePeople doubleheader! 

Today, Josh had two seperate conversations about what America does best... incarerate people... (sigh).  But as always, both of these serious conversations come with snark, and more laughs than should be appropriate.  First, Josh talks to Vice's Anthony Lappé to provide the broad view of the problem, then he sits down with Jeffrey Smith, a former Senator, and a former inmate.  

Enjoy!

Well, Ben Teitelbaum, Kate Balch, and Gemma Sapwell, have a totally pleasant and interesting conversation about Christmas, is what happened.  

No, this is not a typical WTPL, but it is the season of giving, so give we did.

      <description>
        
        
        Hello humans!

Thank you for joining Josh again for another forty minutes of political mayhem.  This week Josh had the pleasure of welcoming an all new, and super talented group of panelist to Pine Box Rock Shop.  

Remember, just the other day, you asked, "How would a political chat go with a former senator, an English podcaster, a comic, and a tv writer?"  Well, enjoy listening to Jeffrey Smith, Felix Salmon, Erica Spera, and Lyle Friedman to find out!

This episode has a bit of everything, sex ed talk, personal stories, domestic issues, foreign policy, and of course, the ever less funny GOP presidential candidate.

        Warning:  this episode contains less than perfect audio quality  (the joys and pitfalls of being live) but soon you'll forget you're hearing a hum, because this episode is intense! 

Josh welcomes back the always lovely and argumentative Derrick Clifton and James West.  He also welcomes, newly found lovely and arguementative Melisa Etehad.  What are they arguing about?  Have the Obama years been a liberal or conservative win?   And you bet, everyone throws down.

      <title>Ep. 17 Joe Rogan Speaks to We The People</title>
      <description>
        
        
        Here it is!

A very special hour long episode of #WTP LIVE!  Host, Josh Zepps, sits down with the comic philosopher Joe Rogan.  

The two compare their world views on Bernie Sanders, inequality, extremism, and just about everything else you'd expect.  But, they don't just cover the news, they examine whether the current events are showing that the human species is evolving towards an enlightenment.  It's quite the hour.  

Thank you so much for listening.

      <description>
        
        
        Hellllllooooo!
We are back live at Pine Box Rock Shop with some ideal guest for this week's lunacy.  Josh was joined by Anthony Lappé and the hosts of Guys We Fucked, Krystyna Hutchinson and Corinne Fisher.  

What's wrestled with this episode?  Some pre-show talk about death rituals, and for your main course: what the hell is happening on college campuses, and are liberals too sensitive?  O yeah, there's a bit at the end about people's rights to be parents, and there's a lot of ripping on Anthony, basically, this is everything you'd expect from us.

        Welcome to WTPL-Unlive!  Our pre-taped series where we tackle one issue for the full half hour!  Our first subject up- Political Correctness.  What is it?  Is it ever good?  What's the line between being PC and being a dick?  

Luckily, Josh is joined by an all-star panel, at Pine Box Rock Shop, to figure it all out.  Big thank you to WTPL regular Michael Brooks, a regular for a reason.  An equally big thank you for new-comers Chris Hamilton and Samhita Mukhopadhyay, if we can book them regularly they will be regulars as well.

      <title>Ep.12 Akilah Hughes, Joe Zimmerman, John Opdycke</title>
      <description>
        
        
        Happy end of summer!  Happy last episode of #WTP LIVE Season 1!!!! What a journey of Trump jokes, robots, and drunk-ness it has been.  And this episode sends us out on a high note.  Chill.  We are back in October.  (Just enough time for you to tell all your Facebook and twitter friends individually about us.)  

Josh was very fortunate to have a great talk with Akilah Hughes, Joe Zimmerman, and John Opdycke, at Pine Box Rock Shop(are gracious and wonderful venue).  Our guest have a tried and true discussion.  A long conversation on the future of A.I., a look back at the stories that dominated the summer, the guy with the terrible hair, and term limits. If summer has to end, this is the conversation to celebrate it with.

      <title>Ep.11 Derrick Clifton, Michael Brooks, Jeff Kreisler</title>
      <description>
        
        
        Yeah, we know 'live' is in the title, but these pre-recorded episodes are really kicking ass.  

Joining Josh at Pine Box Rock Shop was Michael Brooks, Jeff Kreisler, and Derrick Clifton, and what good chemistry these smart people had.  From a somehow silly, but expectedly insightful, conversation on Iran, to a in-depth discussion on gender and trans rights.  This episode kicks ass.  And to wrap it up, there's a hilarious hate session on twitter storms.

      <title>Ep.10 Akilah Hughes, Joanna Rothkopf, Anthony Lappé</title>
      <description>
        
        
        Welcome to the double digits of #WTPL!  Thank you for joining the people who listen to the people who bicker at Pine Box Rock Shop in front of the live people.  You are them.  

Mr. Zepps welcomes the multitalented Joanna Rothkopf, Akilah Hughes, and Anthony Lappé.  People who are good at their day jobs and very good at being funny about trying to win the news.  

First you get a double dose of Hillary.  Hillary + emails, Hillary + Black Lives Matter.  And just when you think this show is leaning right, we talk about Donald Trumps immigration policy.  Once the left and the right get taken to task by our guest, they really pull out the outrage regarding the Fat Jew.  

Check it out, then tweet us your outrage.

        Surprise, this episode was taped in LA.  You didn't think we'd fly out to LA just to do one show did you?  We are sorry that this is not live, but, paradoxically, we are not sorry because it's great.  

Josh was lucky to be joined by three very interesting, very smart, LA based guest for our second show at Hotel Cafe.  Big thank you to Jenny Churchill,  Jimmy Dore, and Debra Wilson.  

With tenacity and comedy the panelist tackle whether it is ethical to be able to delete what comes up in google searches, the sex offenders list, and outer space!  How's that for a half hour?

      <title>Ep.8 Jena Friedman, Myq Kaplan, Scott Rogowsky</title>
      <description>
        
        
        Back to Brooklyn!  LA was great, but there's nothing like doing a live show back at Pine Box Rock Shop! 

What a week in news Josh had to discuss with Jena Friedman, Myq Kaplan, and Scott Rogowsky.  Big thank you for our three lovely panelist and everyone that came out, what a lively LIVE show.  

With equal parts irreverence as inptelligencethese news topics travel into more theoretical spaces (in the funniest way possible).  Our conversation about Bernie Sander getting interrupted by Black Lives Matter protesters ends with discussing vegans who eat meat... it makes sense in context, promise.  The panelist also take on the GOP's performance art.  They reflect on Jon Stewart's legacy and farewell.   And  to close they look at Netflix's new policy, is it for the good, or is there something more cynical?  All of this and starfish in this episode!

      <title>Ep.7 Greg Fitzsimmons, Fred Stoller, Zach Cregger</title>
      <description>
        
        
        #WeThePeople LIVE went live to LA!  And, what a worthwhile trip it was.  

Josh was joined by three very funny men.  Greg Fitzsimmons, Fred Stoller, and Zach Cregger jumped on the panel at the wonderful Hotel Cafe in Hollywood.  Big thank you to the guest, the venue, and the audience. 

This week you'll hear conversation on Biden's potential presidential bid, the Olympic bidding process, that lion story you've heard about, gamers getting drug tested, and how everyone would like to commit murder! Clearly, this is a can't miss episode.

      <title>Ep.6 Jamilah Lemieux, Pete Dominick, Michael Kayne</title>
      <description>
        
        
        Welcome back, thank you for stopping what you're doing, listening to this show and reading this description, you're the best.  This episode is not quite 'live', it was recorded a week previous, but it is quite the exceptional episode!  

Josh wrangled and sparred with three equally opinionated and funny guest, Jamilah Lemieux, Pete Dominick, and Michael Kayne.  Pine Box Rock Shop hosted the hilarity.  We are grateful to the venue and the guest.  

Josh themed this show around identity and how it shapes our politics.  The panel discussed Obama's legacy, race and gender, and immigration policy.  Don't worry, there are plenty of laughs along with the soul searching.

      <title>Ep.5 Dave Hill, Negin Farsad, Andrew Kirell</title>
      <description>
        
        
        Welcome back to a genuinely live #WeThePeople LIVE!  Very proud and excited to bring you this great conversation.  

Josh was honored to quip with Dave Hill, Negin Farad, and Andrew Kirell in front of the hospitable crowd at Pine Box Rock Shop.  

Starting off you'll be hearing a multidimensional debate about prison reform, Obama's statements inside a prison, jails around the world, and, seriously, jails with taco stands.  While that's not quite absurd enough, the conversation following about Iran, Trump VS. everyone, and Miss USA certainly will be.

Josh was in Greece so he took sometime, literally between eating and drinking, to talk to some people.  Enjoy accents, food analogies, insightfulness, and opinions that may be right...if you deem them popular.  

Thank you all for listening.  We will have a new, LIVE, episode ready for your ears Monday.  
Please do us the favor, right a review, or tell your one and only friend about us.

      <title>Ep.4 Tea Hacic, Mychal Denzel Smith, Anthony Fisher</title>
      <description>
        
        
        Welcome back to #WeThePeople LIVE!  As Josh is about to tell you, this is a prerecorded episode, so we took the opportunity to discuss some issues so constant that they get overlooked.  Don't worry, things get just as impassioned as our previous episodes.

Our panelist bringing the passion this week were Tea Hacic, Mychal Denzel Smith, and Anthony Fisher.  We were also honored to have such an engaged audience at Pine Box Rockshop as you're about to hear.  

This episode you'll hear a discussion about ageism (or is it sexism), gentrification, who's middle class, does France matter, and will computers take over (seriously).  All in a half hour!

      <title>Ep.3 Jim Norton, Juan Thompson, Matt Welch</title>
      <description>
        
        
        Hello humans!  Thanks for listening to the first pre-recorded episode of #WeThePeople LIVE!  Yes, pre-recorded and a show with live in the title is a bit of a contradiction, but press play and Josh will explain.  This episode is delightful, we promise.  

This week our guest Jim Norton, Juan Thompson, and Matt Welch, joined Josh at Pinebox Rockshop to talk about issues that effect us, the people, all the time.  

You'll hear heated conversation about American foreign policy, the practices and mentality of the police, and, in Josh's words, "why American elections are so fucking long."

      <title>Ep.2 Sam Seder, Natasha Lennard, James West</title>
      <description>
        
        
        Welcome back to #WeThePeople LIVE! What a week of news we had to discuss drunk and passionately.  

We were honored to have Sam Seder, Natasha Lennard, and James West join Josh and the lovely people at Pinebox Rockshop this week.  

We delve deep into the court's logic about marriage equality, changes in gay identity and what marriage means.  Also, with a more eloquent transition than this sentence, the panel debates the recent terrorist attacks around the globe and how America reports on terrorism.
